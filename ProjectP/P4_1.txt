Greetings, Non-Special Player.
I need your help building a house.
Grab the shovel and help me
dig some dirt for the foundation.
While I enjoy doing nothing.
Not bad, lad.
Now grab the axe and chop down
some logs for wood.
I believe in you kid.
Nicely done, now lastly
Take the pickaxe and mine
some rocks for the roof.
Thanks kid! Here's your reward.
